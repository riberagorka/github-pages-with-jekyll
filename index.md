## Welcome to my Blog

Here I will post everything that I am learning on the area of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Hope you enjoy it!

First of all, I'm going to introduce myself.

My name is Gorka Ribera. Curiosity has haunted me for as long as I have sense of consciousness. Although since childhood we are made to believe that we have to choose a path and cling to it, I firmly believe that knowing different fields and skills enriches us and makes us better people, being able to see things from different perspectives.

Entrepreneurial and proactive personality, lover of challenges, wanting to improve people's lives. All this led me to create my own company at the age of 22, which offered me a first-person view of issues related to business strategy and coordination.

Currently a data science student, focused on the acquisition and improvement of my technical skills related to the areas of machine learning and artificial intelligence. 

My greatest motivation in personal and professional development is continuous improvement.
